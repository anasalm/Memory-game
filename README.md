# Memory_Anton_Anas
We are making a mamory-like game. The user will be presented with a few 
pairs of pictures in a graphical interface. The pictures will then be 
"flipped", and the user must find each pair. When the user is done, 
he/she will be rewarded with points based on time, and accuracy. In the 
future we will add difficulty-settings and different levels


## To play the game:
Clone the repo

*$ git clone https://gits-15.sys.kth.se:anasa/Memory_Anton_Anas.git*

Then simply run the main method in the *Board* class

**Additional information**
The gui was made with the java.swing library
