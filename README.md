# Memory_Anton_Anas
We are making a mamory-like game. The user will be presented with a few pairs of pictures in a graphical interface. The pictures will then be "flipped", and the user must find each pair. When the user is done, he/she will be rewarded with points based on time, and accuracy. In the future we will add difficulty-settings and different levels
