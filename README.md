# Memory_Anton_Anas
We are making a mamory-like game. The user can choose one of four levels. Then the user will be presented with number of pair flipped cards 
in a graphical interface based on which levels. The user must find each pair. When the user is done 
he/she will be presented again with home screen. 
In the future we will add timer and clicks counter. 


## To play the game:
Clone the repo

*$ git clone git@github.com:anasalm/Memory-game.git

Then simply run the Main  class

**Additional information**
The gui was made with the java.swing library
